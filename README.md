# Jon Lugg Chrome Extension

This was a project to learn how to create a basic google chrome extension.

It does work and when installed it allows you to view my social media links.

Please feel free to clone, change the images and change the href links so that you can use it for your social media links.

To install it on google Chrome:

1. type chrome://extensions/ into the address bar.
2. Enable developer mode.
3. Click load unpacked and upload the local repo.
4. Click on the extensions button to the right of the address bar and pin it.
5. Enjoy
